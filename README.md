# Automated Human Temperature and Face Mask Detection Door System
This is part of a group project to design a 8086-based smart system that controls the door automatically based on measured temperature and whether a face mask is present. In this repository, you'll find one assembly program file made specifically to be programmed into the actual hardware, and another assembly program file modified for EMU8086 simulation purposes.
